Hi, I'm Ken! I'm a Software Engineer, and I live with my wife in the northeastern United States.

At work, I tend to work mostly in Java, if I'm working on the backend, and Javascript if I'm working
on frontend stuff. Recently (within the past year) we've adopted [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org)
and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) for our frontend projects. 

When not at work, I enjoy writing [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), Typescript, and developing
for Android, as well as functional languages like Clojure (and Clojurescript) and Elm. I really 
enjoy learning, and exploring new technologies and languages.

I'm really interested in programming languages in general, and have tried to expose myself to a lot of
them (I've even had a go at [writing one myself](https://github.com/kengorab/kage)).

I also enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi (The Stormlight Archives, The Wheel of Time, The Kingkiller 
Chronicle, and of course ASOIAF to name a few) and watching low-budget, high-concept movies (like
[Primer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384), [Time Lapse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2669336),
[Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360) and [The One I Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2756032)).
