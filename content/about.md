Hi, I'm Ken! I'm a Software Engineering Manager, and I live with my wife in the northeastern United States.

At work, I tend to work mostly in Java, if I'm working on the backend, and Javascript if I'm working
on frontend stuff. Recently (within the past year) we've adopted [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org)
and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) for our frontend projects. 

When not at work, I enjoy writing [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), Typescript, and developing
for Android, as well as functional languages like Clojure (and Clojurescript) and Elm. I really 
enjoy learning, and exploring new technologies and languages.

I'm really interested in programming languages in general, and have tried to expose myself to a lot of
them (I've even had a go at [writing one myself](https://github.com/kengorab/kage)).

I also enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi; recently I've been reading through the second Mistborn series, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next book in The Stormlight Archive. I'm also on book 11 of The Wheel of Time, and of course have read ASOIAF (check out [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66527592-ken-gorab) if you're interested). Other than books, I enjoy watching low-budget, high-concept movies (like
[Primer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384), [Time Lapse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2669336),
[Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360) and [The One I Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2756032)).
