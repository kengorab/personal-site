Here are some of the projects that I've created, either for blog posts/articles or for my own personal experimentation; I enjoy
playing around with various languages/frameworks.

*Disclaimer: These projects are mostly just for fun, so don't open them expecting perfection in styling, and there may be bugs 
that I haven't fixed, or even discovered yet.*
