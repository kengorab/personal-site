# Snake Game in Kotlin-JS
An implementation of the classic snake game in Kotlin, compiled to Javascript

The assets in this directory are the result of a successful build of my [kotlin-js-snake](https://github.com/kengorab/kotlin-js-snake)
repo. Should these assets require updating, follow these steps:

  - Clone that repo
  - `./gradlew build`
  - Copy `kotlin.js`, `kotlin-html-js.js`, and `module.js` from `build/js` into the `js` directory here
  - Copy the `index.html` file here, if changed
